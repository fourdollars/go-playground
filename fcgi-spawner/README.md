# Go FastCGI Spawner

This project provides a "spawner" service written in Go, designed to manage and proxy requests to a dynamic pool of FastCGI applications. It enables a convenient "drop-in" deployment model: simply place a compiled FastCGI executable into a designated directory, and the spawner makes it immediately accessible.

The spawner is designed for efficiency and flexibility, supporting two modes of operation for standard request-response applications:
- **Socket Mode**: If the `-socketDir` flag is provided, the spawner will manage Unix sockets for each application, passing the socket path as a command-line argument. This is the recommended mode for production.
- **Stdio Mode**: If `-socketDir` is omitted, the spawner falls back to the classic FastCGI model, communicating with child processes over `stdin`/`stdout`.

In addition to managing applications, the spawner can also serve static files (HTML, CSS, etc.), acting as a simple, lightweight web server.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Drop-in Deployment**: Add new FastCGI applications by simply uploading a compiled binary. No need to restart or reload Nginx.
-   **Sub-path Routing**: Correctly routes requests with sub-paths (e.g., `/my-app.fcgi/users/123`) to the corresponding application.
-   **Dual FCGI Modes**: Supports both **Socket-based** and **Stdio-based** FastCGI applications, configurable via the `-socketDir` flag.
-   **Persistent Processes**: Manages a pool of running FastCGI applications, reusing processes for multiple requests for high performance. This is **not** a CGI-like model.
-   **Idle Process Management**: Automatically terminates application processes after a configurable idle period (`-idleTimeout`) to conserve resources.
-   **Hot-Reloading**: Automatically detects changes (file writes) to `.fcgi` binaries in the `webRoot` and restarts the corresponding child process.
-   **Static File Serving**: Optionally serve static files from a designated directory (`-staticRoot`). Hidden files (starting with `.`) are not served.
-   **Child Process Logging**: Captures and logs the `stdout` (in socket mode) and `stderr` of each spawned FastCGI application for easy debugging.
-   **Security Conscious**: Includes path safety checks to prevent directory traversal attacks.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

The spawner runs as a persistent service that listens for HTTP requests, typically proxied from a web server like Nginx. When a request arrives, the spawner identifies the target FastCGI application from the URL, starts it if it's not already running, and proxies the request to it.

```
                  +---------+      +-------------------+      +----------------------+
User Request      |         |      |                   |      |                      |
----------------->|  Nginx  |----->|  Spawner Service  |----->| Your FCGI App Process|
                  |         |      |  (spawner)        |      | (e.g., hello.fcgi)   |
                  +---------+      +-------------------+      +----------------------+
                                            |
                                            | Serves static file
                                            v
                                     +--------------+
                                     |              |
                                     |  Static Files|
                                     | (e.g. /about)|
                                     +--------------+
```

### Spawner Logic
1.  The spawner receives an HTTP request (e.g., for `/my-app.fcgi/some/path`).
2.  It parses the URL to identify the target application (`my-app.fcgi`).
3.  It checks if a child process for `my-app.fcgi` is already running and if its binary hasn't been modified.
4.  **If running and up-to-date**, it proxies the full request to the existing process.
5.  **If not running, or if the binary has changed**, it starts the `my-app.fcgi` executable.
    - In **Socket Mode**, it passes a Unix socket path as a command-line argument.
    - In **Stdio Mode**, it passes no arguments and prepares to communicate over the process's stdin.
6.  If the requested path does not match an executable FCGI application, the spawner attempts to serve it as a static file (if `-staticRoot` is configured).
7.  Running child processes are monitored and terminated if they remain idle for a specified duration (`-idleTimeout`).
8.  Changes to `.fcgi` binaries in the `webRoot` directory trigger a restart of the corresponding child process.

## üì¶ Example Applications

The `cmd/` directory includes several example applications to demonstrate different capabilities:

-   **`auth`**: A complete OAuth2 login example that supports Google, Facebook, and GitHub.
-   **`hello`**: A simple "Hello World" application.
-   **`env`**: A debugging tool that prints all request details. A great example of supporting both socket and stdio modes, as well as standalone mode.
-   **`time`**: A basic application that displays the current server time.
-   **`sse`**: Demonstrates Server-Sent Events (SSE), showing how to maintain a long-lived connection for streaming data to the client.
-   **`webhook`**: A more complex application using the Gin framework for receiving webhooks.
-   **`websocket`**: An application that demonstrates how to handle protocols like WebSockets that are incompatible with the FastCGI model. It includes a standalone HTTP server mode (`-listenAddr`) and serves as a template for applications that need to bypass the spawner.

## üí° Advanced Applications & Limitations

### Server-Sent Events (SSE)
The FastCGI protocol works well for streaming data in one direction. The `sse` example demonstrates a long-lived connection where the server pushes events to the client, which is fully compatible with the spawner.

### WebSockets (and other protocol upgrades)
The FastCGI protocol does **not** support connection hijacking, which is required for protocols like WebSockets that need a persistent, two-way raw socket.

Therefore, it is **not possible to proxy WebSocket connections through the `fcgi-spawner`**.

### The Standalone Pattern
For applications that require WebSockets or other raw TCP socket manipulations, the recommended solution is to run them as standalone HTTP servers. The `websocket` and `env` example applications demonstrate how to do this by adding a `-listenAddr` flag.

Your web server (e.g., Nginx) should be configured to route traffic for these specific applications directly to their standalone port, while all other FastCGI applications continue to be routed to the spawner.

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

This project includes a `Dockerfile` for easy, containerized deployment. This method bundles Nginx, Supervisor, and the spawner into a single image. The provided configuration runs the spawner in **socket mode**.

#### Step 1: Build the Docker Image
```bash
docker build -t fcgi-spawner .
```

#### Step 2: Build FastCGI Applications
The build script compiles the example applications.
```bash
chmod +x scripts/build.sh
./scripts/build.sh
```

#### Step 3: Run the Container
Run the container, mapping a host port to port 80 in the container and mounting the `web/` directory.
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 -v "$(pwd)/web:/var/www/fcgi" --name fcgi-container fcgi-spawner
```

#### Step 4: Test
You can now test the endpoints for your `.fcgi` applications.
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/env.fcgi
```

## üöÄ Manual Deployment Guide (systemd)

This guide is for deploying the service directly on a Linux server with `systemd`. The provided `systemd` service file configures the spawner to use **socket mode**.

### Step 1: Build Binaries
```bash
chmod +x scripts/build.sh
./scripts/build.sh
```

### Step 2: Deploy Files
The deployment script copies the configuration files, spawner program, and example applications to their final destinations. **Note**: This script uses `sudo`. Please review `scripts/deploy.sh`.
```bash
chmod +x scripts/deploy.sh
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

### Step 3: Enable the Services
1.  **Reload systemd and start the Spawner Service**
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable --now fcgi-spawner.service
    ```

2.  **Check the Service Status**
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status fcgi-spawner.service
    ```

3.  **Enable the Nginx Configuration and Reload**
    ```bash
    sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/go-fcgi.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
    sudo nginx -t
    sudo systemctl reload nginx
    ```

### Step 4: Test
You can now test the endpoints for your `.fcgi` applications.
```bash
curl http://<your_server_ip>/env.fcgi
```

## üìù How to Add Your Own Application

You can write your application in three main patterns.

### Socket-Based Applications (Recommended for FCGI)
These applications receive a Unix socket path as a command-line argument and create a `net.Listener` on that path. This is the most robust method for standard request-response apps.

```go
// cmd/my-socket-app/main.go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"net"
	"net/http"
	"net/http/fcgi"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	if len(os.Args) < 2 {
		log.Fatal("Expected socket path as an argument")
	}
	socketPath := os.Args[1]
	// ... listener setup ...
	ln, err := net.Listen("unix", socketPath)
	if err != nil { log.Fatalf("Failed to listen on socket: %v", err) }
	defer ln.Close()

	http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		w.Write([]byte("Hello from socket app!"))
	})

	log.Println("Socket-based FCGI server starting...")
	if err := fcgi.Serve(ln, nil); err != nil { log.Fatalf("fcgi.Serve failed: %v", err) }
}
```

### Stdio-Based Applications
These applications do not take command-line arguments and communicate over stdin/stdout. `fcgi.Serve` with a `nil` listener handles this automatically.

```go
// cmd/my-stdio-app/main.go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"net/http/fcgi"
)

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		w.Write([]byte("Hello from stdio app!"))
	})

	log.Println("Stdio-based FCGI server starting...")
	if err := fcgi.Serve(nil, nil); err != nil { log.Fatalf("fcgi.Serve failed: %v", err) }
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

The spawner captures the `stdout` and `stderr` of child processes. Check the spawner's logs for output from your application.

**With Docker:**
```bash
docker logs fcgi-container
```

**On a Linux Server (Manual):**
```bash
sudo journalctl -u fcgi-spawner.service -f
```

Common issues:
-   **502 Bad Gateway**: The child process is likely crashing or not responding. Check the spawner logs for errors from your application.
-   **Connection Errors**: If using socket mode, ensure the spawner has permissions to write to the `-socketDir`.
-   **WebSocket (or other upgrade) connections fail**: This is expected when going through the spawner. The `fcgi-spawner` does not support protocol upgrades. Your application must be run in standalone mode to handle these connections. See the "Advanced Applications & Limitations" section for details.
